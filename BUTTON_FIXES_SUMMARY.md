## Integration Instructions

### 🔧 **Step 1: Add the Custom Hook**

The `useTestGeneration` hook is already included in the pushed files. No additional setup required.

### 🔧 **Step 2: Update Component Usage**

Replace your existing test generation component:

```tsx
// Before
import EnhancedTestGeneration from '@/components/enhanced-test-generation';

// After
import EnhancedTestGenerationFixed from '@/components/enhanced-test-generation-fixed';
```

### 🔧 **Step 3: Update API Endpoints (if needed)**

Ensure your backend has these endpoints:

```typescript
// Required API endpoints
POST /api/test-generation/generate
POST /api/test-generation/run
GET /api/test-generation/results/:id
```

### 🔧 **Step 4: Test the Implementation**

1. **Generate Scripts:** Click the button and verify progress display
2. **Run Tests:** Ensure it only activates after script generation
3. **View Results:** Confirm it works after test completion
