# Fix Summary for MATT Automated Testing Tool

This PR addresses the three critical issues you mentioned:

## 1. Projects Not Getting Saved / Auto-Save Feature
**Problem**: Projects were being saved to the database but not refreshing in the UI due to QueryClient configuration with `staleTime: Infinity`.

**Solution**:
- Updated `queryClient.ts` to use `staleTime: 30000` (30 seconds) instead of infinity
- Added `cacheTime: 5 * 60 * 1000` (5 minutes) for proper cache management
- Enhanced `projects-management.tsx` with:
  - Manual "Save Now" button for immediate saves
  - Visual indication when auto-save is pending
  - Refresh button to manually update the project list
  - Force refresh on component mount

## 2. Previous Projects Not Loading
**Problem**: Related to the same QueryClient caching issue preventing data refresh.

**Solution**:
- Modified `modern-dashboard-page.tsx` to:
  - Force invalidate queries on mount
  - Add error handling with toast notifications
  - Invalidate test cases when switching to automated tests tab
  - Properly handle project creation with immediate refresh

## 3. Test Count Mismatch in Automated Tests
**Problem**: The estimated test count was calculated as `selectedTestTypes.length * 12`, which didn't match actual generated tests.

**Solution**:
- Updated `enhanced-test-generation.tsx` with realistic test calculations:
  - Security: 9 tests (3 types × 3 tests each)
  - Functional: 9 tests (3 types × 3 tests each)
  - Non-Functional: 9 tests (3 types × 3 tests each)
  - Specialized: 12 tests (4 types × 3 tests each)
- Added actual test count tracking after generation
- Force refetch test cases after generation

## Additional Improvements
- Added comprehensive logging system (`server/utils/logger.ts`) for better error tracking
- Enhanced error handling throughout the application
- Added retry logic for failed API requests
- Improved user feedback with toast notifications

## Testing Instructions
1. Create a new project and verify it appears immediately in the Projects tab
2. Edit a project and verify auto-save works (shows "Auto-saving in 2 seconds...")
3. Use the "Save Now" button to save immediately
4. Generate tests in the Automated Tests tab and verify the estimated count matches the actual generated tests
5. Check the logs directory for any errors if issues occur

All changes maintain backward compatibility and improve the overall reliability of the application.
